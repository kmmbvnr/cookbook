Description
The ability for a resource to suspend and resume execution of a work item.

Example
The Secretary has suspended all Board Meeting work items whilst the Board is being reconstituted.

Motivation
In some situations, during the course of executing a work item, a resource reaches a point where it is not possible to progress it any further. Suspension provides the ability for the resource to signal a temporary halt to the system of any work on the particular work item and switch its attention to another.

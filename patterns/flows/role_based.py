"""
Description
    This feature allows you to assign specific roles to tasks during the design
    phase. At runtime, these tasks will be distributed to all resources that
    belong to the assigned roles. Roles group resources with similar
    characteristics, making it easier to allocate work effectively.

Example:
    The "Approve Travel Request" task is assigned to Managers.

Motivation
    Role-based Distribution is one of the most common ways to assign work in
    Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS). It allows the system to send tasks
    to the most suitable resources when the task is ready to be worked on. The
    actual resource is only chosen at runtime, providing flexibility. By
    defining roles in the process model, you can identify resource groups
    responsible for specific tasks. This approach makes processes adaptable
    since the exact resources within a role donâ€™t need to be determined until
    execution.
